# S1 Final Project

This is a digital portfolio of art projects I created in Semester 1 (Fall 2021). It also happens to be the final for the class.

## Develop

- Follow these steps to run this Svelte app locally.

Clone & install dependencies...

```sh
git clone https://github.com/exu3/art-sem1
cd art-sem1
yarn
```

... then start the dev server:

```sh
yarn dev
```

Navigate to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## WIP

- Things I still have to do are in `todo.txt`
